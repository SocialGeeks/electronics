#Electronics Workshop for Kids  
* Date: July 16th 6pm - 9pm approved by Melissa  
Jason will be doing HS internship first 2 weeks of July  
Ryan has tee ball tue thurs until 16th.  
Date uncertain.  

## Overview  

I've acquired several electronics kits that I hope would be interesting to children aged 5 - 12  
I have 5 arduinos, 1 NetDuino, and 3 RasPi's with quite an array of component selection. for ages 12 - 18.  
    
The smaller kid's kits have guides to follow, I figured I could assign point difficulty to each guide for younger kids.  
I suspect younger children will enjoy completing the project and praise from their mentor more than competition with other groups. (could be wrong here)  
    
## Challenge board for Arduinos:  

(up to 50 points possible awarded by judges for 'style' or original technique in each challenge

* 100: Print Hello World to screen using RasPi   
* 100: Make pin 10 blink on NetDuino  
* 200: Buzz a piezo given an input  
* 200: Output the value of a variable sensor to the screen
